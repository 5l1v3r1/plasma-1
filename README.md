# PLASMA

Plasma is a command-line intelligence gathering tool inspired by Black Hills' Recon-NG.

The tool is integrated to multiple intel sources and fetches data from them. We tried our best to come up with solutions within the tool for rate limits.

If you do not want any module you can just remove it from there. You can also add your own modules for intel gathering.

# Adding New Modules

Any new module can be added to Plasma. Create a python3 module, place it in ./modules and just call it from the main menu.

Note: It would be really nice if you keep the config files for modules and the main menu separate lathough they are same.

Keep Calm and Gather Intel.
